Changes Made to Website

1. Centered content by centering body and sections so that they aren't too spread out since it made the site look too busy

3. Decreased margins under headings since they were too far apart from their content
4. Changed the background color of sections to a light blue to make them stand out from the background
5. To help with legibility, centered text by adding padding in the sections so that they looked more in line with the site as a whole and whithin their given section
6. Changed background color in the headings to a dark blue to emphasize them, added padding to make them look more centered
7. Increased font size of navigation links to make them stand out as they held more importance, decreased font size of headings since it looked too large in comparison to text in sections, this was to help with readability
8. Added shadow to section and headers to add some depth
9. Added spacing between lines in text to make it easier to read because the text was too close together and looked busy, this helped improved the legibility
